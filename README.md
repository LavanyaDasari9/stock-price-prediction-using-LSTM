# stock-price-prediction-using-LSTM
**INTRODUCTION:**

In  this project we get the stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. 

We will be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method.

In the current situation we have seen a drastic change in the stock market and crypto money. 

By using such a project we may be able to  predict this kind of fluctuation in the related area and be warned before losing any primary investment.

This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.


**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

The stock market is a measure of the health of the economy. When things are bad, the bears, or the sellers dominate the market. 

If everyone sells or dumps their stock, bonds, etc, the market goes down because the value of the investments go down.

That is how the market loses so many points in a single day.

The stock market appears in the news every day. You hear about it every time it reaches a new high or a new low. 

The rate of investment and business opportunities in the Stock market can increase if an efficient algorithm could be devised to predict the short term price of an individual stock.

**OBJECTIVES**

The change in price of the stock over time 

 The daily return of the stock on average
 
 The moving average of the various stocks 
 
 The correlation between different stocks 
 
 How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
 
 How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
